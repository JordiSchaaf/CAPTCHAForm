# CAPTCHAForm
This is my submission for the Hackathon with Lewis, of Lewis Menelaws.<br>
CAPTCHAForm is a combination of a captcha and a form, which takes security to the next level.
Besides that it comes with some other benefits: you can check your answers again and it 
provides a challenge for people who think normal captchas are too easy.

The project is written in Vue 3, with TailwindCSS.

## Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Type-Check, Compile and Minify for Production

```sh
npm run build
```
